# Precision Measurements of CKM Matrix elements (Flavor Physics)

This project was carried out following the [**REYES 2023**](https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists), during the period of August to November, under the guidance of **Dr. Sergi Gonzàlez-Solís**.

## Objective

To extract the CKM matrix element Vub, the shape parameter alpha, the form factor normalization  f_+(0), and their associated uncertainties for precision flavor physics measurements.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy 
```

## Project Workflow

The complete analysis is implemented in the Jupyter notebook `CKM (1)_revised`.
